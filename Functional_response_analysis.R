# Functional response of four predator species to varied densities of stink bug eggs

#bring data in

#create subsets for each species

#we're going to use the approach of a two stage analysis. Basically, step one is determine
#what the response is, then step 2 is fit the data to the appropriate response and build a plot

#step 1- find out the fit

# fit to Juilano 2001 model to determine type of functional response for each species
# juliano created an nth order logistic equation to model the relationship between the number
# of prey consumed and the initial prey density. It should be sufficient to take this model 
# just to cubic form, and if the fit is poor from there, reduce the order.
# The way this fit is used, if the linear coefficient (P1) is negative
# then we consider the functional response to be of type II, but if it's positive
# then the functional response is type III. If P1 is not significant, reduce the order 
# (ie set P3 to zero) and refit.
