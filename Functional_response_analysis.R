# Functional response of four predator species to varied densities of stink bug eggs

#bring data in

#create subsets for each species

#fit to Junilano 2001 model to determine type of functional response for each species

#fit curve of relevant type to determine consumption rate as a function of egg density

#create plots to illustrate
